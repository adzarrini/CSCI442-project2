Hours Spent: 25 hr

Files and what they do:
main.cpp, in charge of displaying data using the system information that was taken from the various files
All files in the info/ directory are used to modularly organize and get the information from various files.
This includes the processes, memory, calculation of some other variables in the system, cpu information, timing, and more.
They are organized by their names in the file. Very good naming scheme for these files. Mostly just read in values from other files.

No unusual/intersesting features. May not fully work on the first try. Might have to run more than once. Should work mostly.
Code may act unusually and break process. Very rare. Could not find bug.
Assitance from other students was essential in completing this project. 

Ideal terminal size: resize to fit
full screen is best choice. Columns: ~46 Rows: ~7
